# MyReads Project

This is a project developed for React Nanodegree course at udacity.

## How to Install

For run the project we'll need to <i>npm</i> or <i>yarn</> libs installed. If you don't have npm/nodejs please visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and have a look how easy is installing nodejs and make npm ready for use :) 
     
First, open the root folder in terminal and type npm install or yarn install. (For use yarn the package must be installed - <i> npm install yarn </i>)
Then, start the website using the command <i>yarn start</i> or <i>npm start</i>

## Project Structure

- I tried to keep code cleanest as I could, for that I used <i>eslint</i> using airbnb style and also prettier for code format. ESLINT extends:  "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
- I also kept all state control in the parent component using the most part of child component as functional components (as long they don't need to control any state).  (https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)


## Improvements: TODO

- Implement Tests for features
